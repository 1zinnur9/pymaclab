What is PyMacLab?
=======================

  At the moment, PyMacLab is a simple-to-use library enabling users to calibrate and solve DSGE models based on a number of well-known and
  efficient solution algorithms. It works in the tradition of real business cycle analysis and thus permits users to simulate and analyze
  artificial economies build from micro foundations. It is very convenient to use and emphasizes intuition, ease-of-use and extensibility.
  It is also free and does not depend on any other proprietary software.

  What PyMacLab is *not yet* is an estimation framework for DSGE models in which data can be used to estimated deep structure parameters. But it
  is only a small step away from that ability. For instance, implementing a limited-information estimation method minimizing the distance between
  theoretical impulse responses and those provided by a corresponding SVAR would barely take a couple of days or so to program. Bayesian estimation
  is not on the todo-list yet and may take a little longer to implement. Professional users are welcome to use the existing functionality of PyMacLab
  as a convenient starting point based on a robust code base in order to implement some of these yet missing features.
