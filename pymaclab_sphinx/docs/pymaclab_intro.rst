What is PyMacLab?
=======================

  At the moment, PyMacLab is a simple-to-use library enabling users to calibrate and solve DSGE models based on a number of well-known and
  efficient solution algorithms. It works in the tradition of real business cycle analysis and this permits users to simulate and analyze
  artificial economies. It is very convenient to use and emphasizes intuition and ease-of-use. It is also free and does not depend on any other
  proprietary software.

  What PyMacLab is not yet is an estimation framework for DSGE models in which data can be used to estimated deep structure parameters. But it
  is only a small step away from that ability. For instance, implementing a limited-information estimation method minimizing the distance between
  theoretical impulse responses and those provided by a corresponding SVAR would barely take a week or so to program. Bayesian estimation is
  not on the list yet and may take a little longer to implement.
